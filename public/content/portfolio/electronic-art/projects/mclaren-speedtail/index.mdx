# McLaren Speedtail

The Speedtail was my most ambitious Blender project. I pushed for photorealistic renders, focusing on accurate materials, lighting, and environment reflections.

This car's design later inspired my F1 in Schools car's aerodynamic features - the streamlined body and elongated tail are perfect for reducing drag.
