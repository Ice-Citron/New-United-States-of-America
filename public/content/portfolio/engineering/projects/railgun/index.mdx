# Introduction

This is my journey building a functional electromagnetic railgun - from initial failed attempts in November 2023 to a working augmented railgun design by December 2024.

I started building this railgun because I saw a DIY railgun on YouTube and thought it looked very cool. But my initial motivation evolved significantly when I discovered how railguns are used in the Nuclear Fusion industry. First Light Fusion, a UK private fusion firm, uses railguns to achieve inertial confinement fusion for their Machine 3.

I want to stress that I'm not building a railgun for it to become a weapon. It would make a very terrible weapon due to durability issues - which is, in fact, why the US military cancelled their railgun project. Missiles or lasers simply make much more sense cost-wise given our current level of material science.

Through this project, I gained invaluable experience with LS-Dyna FEA simulations, high-voltage electronics, transformer design, and hands-on fabrication techniques. The experience from using LS-Dyna and Ansys Fluent (from F1 in Schools) is extremely useful for my future plans - tackling Nuclear Fusion by building a multiphysics FEA-driven deep learning system to model plasma instabilities.

From here on, I will start talking about my Railgun building process/project. 

I started building this railgun because I saw a DIY railgun on youtube, and thought that it looked very cool. But, previously, back in November 2023, my manufacturing technique was simply just very inadequate. As my understanding behind railgun's theory was very limited. 

This version failed to fire at all, because initially I never really found a way to charge the capacitors. Furthermore, a cardinal sin was using aluminium. Because aluminium have the very bad habit of oxidising and creating a very high resistance layer. Which, even if I was able to charge the capacitor all the way back in November, it would likely still have been very inefficient, because high resistance means that the time constant T=RC of this RC circuit is significantly increased. Which is not ideal, because this means the capacitor takes longer to discharge, which decreases peak current, which decreases current density and B field. Meaning weaker lorentz force.

This image contains me trying to charge capacitors using crocodile clip wires. Which isn't good because these wires have very high resistance. And I was using my physics lab's pre-made 50 kV power supply. Which, one would expect the 50 kV power supply to be sufficient for charging my 400V aluminium electrolytic capacitor.

But this didn't worked at all, because that power supply isn't intended for charging capacitors, but high voltage low amperage (and I mean insanely low, like 10^-6 low or something like that) experiments. Because it have a 50 megaohm resistor installed. Which means charging my capacitor to 400V would've theoretically take 400 hours, which is absolutely absurd. 

So for a long time, I abandoned this project.

Despite failing initially, I still decided to do my IB Physics IA on railguns. Because at this point I've already had a lot of understanding about the theory side of railguns. 

Which the video shows me playing, inside LS prepost, the d3plot file calculated via LS-Dyna. 

Forgot to say this but, the experience gained here from using LS-Dyna and Ansys Fluent (from F1 in Schools) is extremely useful currently, looking back. As currently coupled with my experience with Deep learning and wanting to solve Nuclear Fusion, currently I have plenty of ideas on how I want to tackle Nuclear Fusion. 

As I believe that Fusion’s main hurdle is modelling plasma-instabilities, an area where conventional mathematical models have struggled. My plans is to tackle Fusion by building a multiphysics Finite-Element-Analysis (FEA)-driven deep learning system to comprehensively model plasma instabilities. Hence, these projects have significantly boosted me in doing such (my future plans). I plan to start this project at Caltech by December 2025.

I decided to start building my railgun again though after mid 2024. Because I realised how railgun are used in the Nuclear Fusion industry as well! First Light Fusion, a UK private fusion firm uses railguns to achieve inertial confinement fusion for their Machine 3. 

Which makes a lot of sense from the perspective of Nuclear Fusion. As for inertial confinement Fusion, like First Light Fusion (FLF)'s approach, one needs high velocity to smash a "target" at very high speeds. Which FLF initially tried doing this via bullets powered by gunpowder/chemical propellant. Which chemical projectiles are terrible, because you are significantly constrained by the chemical properties of the fuel itself. Unlike railguns, for railguns, what's really interesting about it is that, you can keep dumping more and more current into it, and there's no constraint! It just moves faster!

Hence, I was once again inspired in building a railgun. This time for a much more novel cause I would say. I also want to stress that I'm not building a railgun for it to become a weapon. Which, I think it would make a very terrible weapon because of how terrible it's durability is. Which durability issues is, in fact, the reason why the US military had cancelled their railgun project. As missles or laser simply makes much more sense cost-wise given our current level of material-science.

This image is me trying to coil turns for my ZVS transformer. Initially life was very tough when trying to charge my capacitors to 400V. As I had to ensure that I am doing everything safely (like not overcharging my capacitors or charging it too quickly) because I have heard far too many horror stories that occured with high-voltage capacitors. Hence progress was significantly slowed. 

I also had to scalp through the internet for ways of charging a capacitor at 400V. Which it took a long while but I made it in the end. Because on the internet, there's who build transformers before, but the issue is, for them, building a transformer sounds like common-sense, which to me now it currently is. Which makes finding information on how to build a transformer insanely hard. Alternatively, the other type of videos on youtube is just high school level physics, which doesn't help much. 

And I need to say that building a step-up transformer, converting DC to AC back to DC was a lot harder than imagined, compared to what you get on a textbook.

This image showcases my initial attempt at testing my ZVS transformer. 

The ZVS driver can be seen in the image, powered by a DC power supply I borrowed from MCM. 

I learned a lot more as well about transformers. As I realised that for a ZVS design for example, building a step-up transformer isn't as easy as just plugging in 60 hertz AC for example, then expecting 60 hertz out. As a ZVS driver is actually needed to convert my DC input, into extremely high frequency AC output, at like millions of hertz. Because if not, the energy loss would be far too significant. 

The ZVS transformer then outputs to a full bridge rectifier, converting the AC current back to DC. Building the full bridge rectifier itself wasn't easy too. As I realised how much was my soldering techniques lacking.

This image showcases one of my first full bridge rectifier that I built. 

It blown up because the output of my transformer was farrr too high initially. As I simply coiled it far too much. At 30,000+ Volts. And even the air was being ionised into a purple plasma. 

I had to coil it down manually until it's suitable for charging my 400V capacitors. 

One time, I accidentally overcharged my capacitor using a transformer that had far too many coils. Charged the capacitor rated for 400V to 800V. Thankfully, it didn't explode and I was also wearing safety gloves.

This image showcase my version 2 Railgun setup. 

It was still very inefficient (because of crocodile wire and aluminium rods increasing resistance) and hence I wasn't really proud of it still. It uses a spring-launch mechanism. 

The capacitors can be seen held in a plastic box though. As I was afraid of capacitor failures resulting in capacitor explosion.

This image showcase the firing sequence of my v2 Railgun. 

As you can see, it was very inefficient. Further, the projectile itself was also a bit too big and heavy. Hence, this was changed in my final iteration. Where I used soldered wire, copper bars and a 0.8 gram copper stapler instead as my armature.

It's around this time when I stumbled upon an Indonesian railgun enthusiast on Facebook (“Yoga Dora Emon AP”). He guided me immensely by pointing me in the right direction and played a huge role in my success of my final version. 

He recommended me to build an augmented railgun. Which the idea is that the railgun would have more rails on the side and additional coils on the top and bottom of the armature path. (Just need to ensure that it's wired correctly so the current is travelling in the right direction to increase lorentz force instead of cancelling it out) As the idea was to use the same amount of current outputted by the capacitors, but by having these augmented sections, the magnetic field experienced by the armature is significantly strengthened. Allowing greater railgun efficiency. 

I didn't believed this at first, so I tried testing it inside LS-Dyna. It was a lot more efficient! So I started building it.

This image shows the viewport as I designed my augmented railgun after sketching out a blueprint on paper. It's modelled inside Blender, which is then exported using the SVG plugin. Which, one of the SVG files can be seen in the top right hand corner of this screenshot. 

This SVG file was then subsequently used for laser cutting the acrylic sheets.

  height={600}
/>

These images, created inside Google Drawings for my Physics Coursework more clearly demonstrates what I meant by how the augmented coil and rails work inside my augmented railgun. 

As the idea is for the current to travel near the armature for much longer, which in theory will strengthen the armature's lorentz force exerted, as the B field and J field's distributions' magnitude are significantly increased.

Furthermore, as seen in this image. You must ensure that the current is always travelling in the same direction for LHS and a different direction for all coils and rails on the RHS. Because if this wasn't done so, the lorentz force will cancel each other out for the armature, failing our initial objectives.

In this screenshot, you can see all of the components required to construct my augmented railgun design which I successfully did with the assistance of Mr Fauzi, the workshop technician. (He played a huge role by coming into school during December of 2024, as my fabrication techniques like metal-working were very inadequate).

The acrylic panels in the middle can be seen, which the have been fabricated via laser cutting. Alongside with the augmented coils and rails fabricated from cutting M6 copper rods.

---

I laser cutted a jig (the brown acrylic sheet), to ensure that the gap between the rails are uniform. Else the armature would get stuck between the rails during firing sequence.

A huge thanks to Mr Fauzi here, as he helped me to make the capacitor bank a lot more robust and safer via laser cutting. 

My favourite part is the manufacturing of the copper bar that connects the capacitors, which is subsequently soldered. Because we didn't have any copper bars in school, Mr Fauzi manufactured the copper bar by first cutting a copper pipe in half and then flattened it via a hammer. Which is a very insightful trick for me, as I never thought that metal can be shaped this easily by using a hammer alone.

---

A diode was also soldered onto the capacitor bank as well, to preserve the lifespan of the capacitor bank.

# Final Stage

## Safety and PPE

  height={600}
/>

As mentioned, capacitors are terrifyingly dangerous. You can't tell when they have residual charge left, hence frequently I would continuously measure each one of them to ensure they are fully discharged.

Throughout the experiment, as seen in the screenshot, proper PPE had always been worn, from face shield, rubber boots, rubber gloves rated for 12kV to lab coat.

When charging, the capacitor banks are placed under a plastic box, just in case of risk of capacitor explosion.

<br></br>
<br></br>

## Capacitor Bank Setup

In this image, my railgun's capacitor bank setup can be seen. On the very left, the capacitor bank can be seen, which a significant improvement I made was, with the help of Mr Fauzi, I created a jig/box to directly insert the capacitor together and soldered them together. This significantly helped reduce contact resistance issues which plagued Version 2 Railgun.

In the middle of the table, a 24V 15A power supply can be seen powering a ZVS driver, which powers a Ferrite-core transformer that I coiled by hand manually.

This is the more fun videos. Though you can still see that PPE had been taken very seriously throughout, as high voltage and capacitors are very very dangerous.

Boom, it fired as the big red button is pressed.

Though this design was decommissioned later as the button itself is only rated for 20A, whilst we likely had 1000+ Amps during the firing sequence due to the capacitors discharging. Which, this caused the switch to break, as it's likely welded as a consequence of the high current.

But the red button does look cooler tho.
