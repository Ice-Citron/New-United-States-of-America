## Introduction

I've been designing and building a multi-stage railgun to explore electromagnetic propulsion. 
The project involves coil arrangement, projectile design, and high-voltage testing.

### Coil Arrangement

Here's the first test firing at 300V capacitor bank, capturing projectile speed data...

### Next Steps

More testing at higher voltages, improved projectile materials, and further simulation with ANSYS EM...
