From here on, I will start talking about my Railgun building process/project. 

I started building this railgun because I saw a DIY railgun on youtube, and thought that it looked very cool. But, previously, back in November 2023, my manufacturing technique was simply just very inadequate. As my understanding behind railgun's theory was very limited. 

This version failed to fire at all, because initially I never really found a way to charge the capacitors. Furthermore, a cardinal sin was using aluminium. Because aluminium have the very bad habit of oxidising and creating a very high resistance layer. Which, even if I was able to charge the capacitor all the way back in November, it would likely still have been very inefficient, because high resistance means that the time constant T=RC of this RC circuit is significantly increased. Which is not ideal, because this means the capacitor takes longer to discharge, which decreases peak current, which decreases current density and B field. Meaning weaker lorentz force.

This image contains me trying to charge capacitors using crocodile clip wires. Which isn't good because these wires have very high resistance. And I was using my physics lab's pre-made 50 kV power supply. Which, one would expect the 50 kV power supply to be sufficient for charging my 400V aluminium electrolytic capacitor.

But this didn't worked at all, because that power supply isn't intended for charging capacitors, but high voltage low amperage (and I mean insanely low, like 10^-6 low or something like that) experiments. Because it have a 50 megaohm resistor installed. Which means charging my capacitor to 400V would've theoretically take 400 hours, which is absolutely absurd. 

So for a long time, I abandoned this project.

Despite failing initially, I still decided to do my IB Physics IA on railguns. Because at this point I've already had a lot of understanding about the theory side of railguns. 

Which the video shows me playing, inside LS prepost, the d3plot file calculated via LS-Dyna. 

Forgot to say this but, the experience gained here from using LS-Dyna and Ansys Fluent (from F1 in Schools) is extremely useful currently, looking back. As currently coupled with my experience with Deep learning and wanting to solve Nuclear Fusion, currently I have plenty of ideas on how I want to tackle Nuclear Fusion. 

As I believe that Fusionâ€™s main hurdle is modelling plasma-instabilities, an area where conventional mathematical models have struggled. My plans is to tackle Fusion by building a multiphysics Finite-Element-Analysis (FEA)-driven deep learning system to comprehensively model plasma instabilities. Hence, these projects have significantly boosted me in doing such (my future plans). I plan to start this project at Caltech by December 2025.

I decided to start building my railgun again though after mid 2024. Because I realised how railgun are used in the Nuclear Fusion industry as well! First Light Fusion, a UK private fusion firm uses railguns to achieve inertial confinement fusion for their Machine 3. 

Which makes a lot of sense from the perspective of Nuclear Fusion. As for inertial confinement Fusion, like First Light Fusion (FLF)'s approach, one needs high velocity to smash a "target" at very high speeds. Which FLF initially tried doing this via bullets powered by gunpowder/chemical propellant. Which chemical projectiles are terrible, because you are significantly constrained by the chemical properties of the fuel itself. Unlike railguns, for railguns, what's really interesting about it is that, you can keep dumping more and more current into it, and there's no constraint! It just moves faster!

Hence, I was once again inspired in building a railgun. This time for a much more novel cause I would say. I also want to stress that I'm not building a railgun for it to become a weapon. Which, I think it would make a very terrible weapon because of how terrible it's durability is. Which durability issues is, in fact, the reason why the US military had cancelled their railgun project. As missles or laser simply makes much more sense cost-wise given our current level of material-science.

This image is me trying to coil turns for my ZVS transformer. Initially life was very tough when trying to charge my capacitors to 400V. As I had to ensure that I am doing everything safely (like not overcharging my capacitors or charging it too quickly) because I have heard far too many horror stories that occured with high-voltage capacitors. Hence progress was significantly slowed. 

I also had to scalp through the internet for ways of charging a capacitor at 400V. Which it took a long while but I made it in the end. Because on the internet, there's who build transformers before, but the issue is, for them, building a transformer sounds like common-sense, which to me now it currently is. Which makes finding information on how to build a transformer insanely hard. Alternatively, the other type of videos on youtube is just high school level physics, which doesn't help much. 

And I need to say that building a step-up transformer, converting DC to AC back to DC was a lot harder than imagined, compared to what you get on a textbook.
