# Introduction

This is my iGCSE Design & Technology coursework project - a Persistence of Vision (POV) Display Spinner. The project combines 3D CAD modeling, laser cutting, Arduino programming, and electronics to create an interactive display system.

The display spinner uses the persistence of vision effect - when LEDs spin fast enough, they create the illusion of a solid image floating in mid-air. The system includes motion sensors for automatic activation, a real-time clock for scheduling, and motor speed control via potentiometer.

# Design Process

## Design Iterations

<MyCarousel

      caption: "Design evolution from concept to final"
    }
  ]}

/>

The design went through multiple iterations, starting from initial concepts and evolving based on manufacturing constraints and functional requirements. Each version improved upon the previous, addressing issues like balance, motor mounting, and LED visibility.

## Final Renders

    {
      src: "/content/portfolio/engineering/projects/display-spinner/images/final-render-1.png",
      caption: "Final design render - front view"
    },
    {

      caption: "Final design render - perspective view"
    }
  ]}
  width={900}

/>

The final design was modeled and rendered in Blender, allowing me to visualize the complete assembly before manufacturing. This helped identify potential issues and refine the aesthetics of the final product.

# Technical Documentation

## Exploded View

<MyCarousel
  slides={[
    {
      src: "/content/portfolio/engineering/projects/display-spinner/images/exploded-view.png",
      caption: "Exploded view showing all components"
    }
  ]}
  width={900}
  height={600}
/>

The exploded view diagram shows all the components and how they fit together. The main structure is laser-cut acrylic, with the motor mounted at the base and the LED array on the spinning arm.

## Blueprints

<MyCarousel
  slides={[
    {
      src: "/content/portfolio/engineering/projects/display-spinner/images/blueprint-1.png",
      caption: "Technical blueprint with dimensions"
    }
  ]}
  width={900}
  height={600}
/>

Detailed blueprints were created for laser cutting the acrylic components. All dimensions were carefully calculated to ensure proper fit and balance during rotation.

# Electronics & Programming

## Arduino System

The display spinner is controlled by an Arduino Mega with the following features:

**Sensors & Inputs:**
- 4x PIR motion sensors for automatic activation
- Potentiometer for motor speed control
- 4x Control buttons for mode selection
- Real-time clock (DS1302) for scheduled operation

**Outputs:**
- BTS7960 motor driver for PWM speed control
- 4x Relay modules for LED control
- LED array for POV display

**Smart Features:**
- Automatic activation when motion is detected
- Time-based pause duration (longer during day hours 8AM-8PM)
- Calibration sequence on startup
- Debounced button inputs

```cpp
// Key components used:
#include <ezButton.h>
#include <virtuabotixRTC.h>

// Motor control pins
int R_EN = 2;
int R_PWM = 3;
int L_EN = 4;

// PIR sensors on pins 5-8
// Relays on pins 9-12
// RTC on pins 50-52
```

<br></br>

# Manufacturing

## Laser Cutting

The main structure was manufactured using laser cutting on acrylic sheets. The SVG files were exported from Blender and used to precisely cut all the components.

## Assembly

The assembly process involved:
1. Laser cutting acrylic panels
2. Mounting the motor and bearings
3. Wiring the LED array with slip rings for power transfer
4. Installing the Arduino and sensor array
5. Programming and calibration

# Skills Developed

Through this iGCSE DT coursework, I developed skills in:

- **3D CAD Modeling** - Blender for design and rendering
- **Technical Drawing** - Creating detailed blueprints with proper annotations
- **Arduino Programming** - C++ for embedded systems
- **Electronics** - Motor drivers, relays, sensors, and power management
- **Manufacturing** - Laser cutting and assembly techniques
- **Project Management** - Iterative design process and documentation

This project laid the foundation for my later engineering work, including F1 in Schools and the Railgun project, where I applied similar CAD, manufacturing, and electronics skills at a more advanced level.
