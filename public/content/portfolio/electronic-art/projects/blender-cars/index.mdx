# Introduction

This is my preliminary experience in Blender, starting during COVID lockdown in Grade 8. I followed BlenderGuru's introductory course to Blender and then kept modeling and rendering my favorite cars.

I spent far too much time on these projects, but I had all the time in the world during lockdown. By the end, my Blender technique had improved significantly - from basic donut tutorials to photorealistic car renders.

# McLaren P1

    }

The McLaren P1 was one of my favorite projects. I focused on getting the aerodynamic details right - the active rear wing, the complex air intakes, and the distinctive P1 silhouette.

# McLaren Speedtail

      caption: "McLaren Speedtail - Rear view"
    }
  ]}

The Speedtail was my most ambitious project. I pushed for photorealistic renders, focusing on accurate materials, lighting, and environment reflections. This car's design later inspired my F1 in Schools car's aerodynamic features.

# Ferrari LaFerrari

      caption: "Ferrari LaFerrari - Rear view"
    }
  ]}

The LaFerrari showcases the iconic Ferrari design language - the aggressive front splitter, active aerodynamics, and the distinctive rear end.

# Mercedes-Benz G Class

    {
      src: "/content/portfolio/electronic-art/projects/blender-cars/images/g-class-front.png",
      caption: "Mercedes G Class - Front view"

    {
      src: "/content/portfolio/electronic-art/projects/blender-cars/images/g-class-rear.png",
      caption: "Mercedes G Class - Rear view"
    }
  ]}
  width={900}
  height={600}
/>

A departure from hypercars, the G Class was a challenge in modeling boxy, angular shapes while maintaining visual interest.

# Dodge Challenger

    {

    {
      src: "/content/portfolio/electronic-art/projects/blender-cars/images/dodge-challenger-blue.png",
      caption: "Dodge Challenger - Baby blue"
    }
  ]}
  width={900}
  height={600}
/>

This was the first car I ever made in Blender. I followed along with a car modeling course and chose the Challenger for its classic American muscle car aesthetic.

# Beginnings - The Donut

Where it all began - following BlenderGuru's famous donut tutorial. This coffee cup render was part of the introductory course that taught me the fundamentals of Blender's interface, modeling, texturing, and rendering.
