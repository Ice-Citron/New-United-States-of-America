# Introduction

This is a collaborative science project where my group designed and built a solar water heater. The project explored renewable energy principles, thermodynamics, and practical engineering to create a functional system that heats water using solar energy.

The solar heater uses black tubing to maximize heat absorption from sunlight. Water circulates through the system, absorbing thermal energy as it passes through the sun-exposed tubes.

# Testing

We tested the system's efficiency by measuring water temperature increase over time under various sunlight conditions.

# Principles

**How Solar Water Heating Works:**

1. **Absorption** - Black surfaces absorb more solar radiation than lighter colors
2. **Conduction** - Heat transfers from the tube surface to the water inside
3. **Convection** - Heated water naturally rises, creating circulation
4. **Insulation** - Minimizing heat loss to maintain temperature
