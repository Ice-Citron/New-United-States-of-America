# Introduction

This is an earlier DT project where I designed and built a marble maze puzzle. The project involved 3D modeling in Blender, manufacturing planning, and hands-on fabrication.

The maze was designed in Blender, allowing me to visualize the puzzle layout and plan the manufacturing process before cutting any materials.

# Final Product

  slides={[
    {
      type: "video",
      src: "/content/portfolio/engineering/projects/maze/images/maze-video.mov",
      videoType: "video/mp4",
      caption: "Marble maze in action"
    }
  ]}
  width={900}
  height={500}
/>

The completed maze demonstrates the puzzle mechanics with a marble navigating through the paths.
