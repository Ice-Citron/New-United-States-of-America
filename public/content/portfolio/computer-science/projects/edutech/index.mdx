# Introduction

Recon Drone is an AI-powered waste detection system developed for Google's Edutech Asia competition, where our team won the **Champions** title. I served as the chief ML engineer and initial team lead, responsible for the entire AI pipeline.

The project combines autonomous drone navigation with computer vision to solve waste management challenges. A DJI drone covers designated routes, capturing images that are processed through a YOLOv11 CNN model for waste detection.

**Recon Drone** is a comprehensive waste management solution:

1. **ReactJS WebApp** (by Jonatas and Jolie) - Pre-programs drone routes and displays detection results
2. **DJI Drone Integration** (by Louis Gan) - Uses DJI SDK for autonomous flight along designated paths
3. **AI Detection Pipeline** (by me) - YOLOv11 model trained on waste detection datasets
4. **Edge Processing** - Inference runs on Nvidia Jetson Nano or Google Firebase backend

# My Role

As chief ML engineer, I was responsible for:

- **Model Training**: Trained YOLOv11 CNN using Google Colab and Nvidia H100 GPUs (rented from Tensordock)
- **Pipeline Development**: Built the inference pipeline for real-time waste detection
- **System Integration**: Connected the AI model with the drone's image capture system
- **Team Leadership**: Initially led the team before transferring leadership to Jolie Teo

My workflow followed a similar pattern to GPT-Valkyrie - prototyping on Google Colab's cheaper L4 GPUs before deploying training jobs to H100s for production.

During competition day at Marina Bay Sands, Singapore, we showcased our solution in a pit-display format. It was a great experience - Singapore truly is a tech powerhouse.

**Achievements:**
- **Champions** of Google Edutech Asia 2024
- Received Chromebooks from Google as prizes
- Approached by Singaporean investors for potential funding
- Pitched the concept in a full-school assembly

The leadership experience gained here, in a business environment, has been valuable for my future goals of creating a fusion energy startup.
