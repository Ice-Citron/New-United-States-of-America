# Introduction

In Summer 2023, before the AI wave took off and before I got involved with F1 in Schools, I spent 200+ hours learning C++, Asahi Linux, and OpenGL from TheCherno on YouTube.

The result: I built a fully functional game engine from scratch!

This video showcases the game engine I built following TheCherno's Sparky Engine tutorial series. The engine features:

- Custom OpenGL renderer
- Entity-component system
- Shader management
- Window handling and input system
- Layer stack for game logic

# Learning Path

My journey into low-level programming followed a structured path:

1. **C++ Fundamentals** - TheCherno's C++ tutorial series
2. **OpenGL Basics** - Understanding graphics pipeline, shaders, and rendering
3. **Hazel Engine** - Advanced game engine architecture (ongoing)

I also set up **Asahi Linux** on my MacBook to have a proper development environment for OpenGL work, learning Linux system administration along the way.
