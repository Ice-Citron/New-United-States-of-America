# Blender Donut Tutorial

Where it all began - following BlenderGuru's famous donut tutorial during COVID lockdown in Grade 8.

I spent far too much time on this, but I had all the time in the world during lockdown. This introductory course taught me the fundamentals of Blender's interface, modeling, texturing, and rendering.
