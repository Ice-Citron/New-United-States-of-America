# Introduction

This is an earlier DT project where I designed and built a pinhole camera (camera obscura). The project explored the fundamental principles of photography and optics through hands-on construction.

A pinhole camera works on the principle that light travels in straight lines. When light passes through a tiny hole, it projects an inverted image on the opposite surface. This project taught me the fundamentals of optics that would later prove useful in understanding lens systems and image formation.

# How It Works

1. **Light enters** through a tiny pinhole
2. **Rays project** onto the back surface
3. **Image forms** inverted (upside-down and reversed)
4. The smaller the hole, the sharper (but dimmer) the image

# Skills Developed

- Understanding of optical principles
- Precision manufacturing (the pinhole size is critical)
- Light-tight construction techniques
- Documentation and scientific observation
